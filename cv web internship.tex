\section*{Objective}
I love software development. I'm currently studying for an engineering degree in computer science at Malmö University. I'm interested in web-programming, both back and front end. In the web world I've got experience from a number of school and private projects, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scraping and putting apartments for rent on a map (Python, JavaScript, HTML, MySQL, Google Maps API), see \url{http://leiflandia.se/boplats/}
\item Web-based RESTful application server for data synchronization with an Android device and data presentation on the web (Java EE, MySQL, Hibernate (ORM), HTML, JavaScript, Google Maps API), see \url{https://github.com/grupp6/HelmetServer} (source code).
\item Web-service helping me to quit smoking by tracking number of cigarettes smoked over time and presenting this information in a pretty graph (PHP, MySQL).
\end{itemize}
I'm now looking for an internship to gain further experience and get contacts in the business.

2010--2012&{\bf Product evaluation assistant at Syngenta Seeds AB.}\\
&At Syngenta I had the opportunity to work in collaboration with their statistician (Rikard Alm) on some interesting projects that included data mining, statistical analysis and visualization of historical trial data. I was also involved in a software migration project to develop reports in Crystal Reports and writing user documentation together with a team of developers in the USA and Egypt. My routine tasks included data management and assisting in trial planning within the PE group.\\
